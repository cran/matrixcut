Description: The user must supply a matrix filled with similarity values. The software will search for significant differences between similarity values at different hierarchical levels. The algorithm will return a Loess-smoothed plot of the similarity values along with the inflection point, if there are any. There is the option to search for an inflection point within a specified range. The package also has a function that will return the matrix components at a specified cutoff.
